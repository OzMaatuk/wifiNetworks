scapy-fakeap
============

Fake wireless Access Point (AP) implementation using Python and Scapy, intended for convenient testing of 802.11 protocols and implementations. This library is a work in progress, and currently only supports open 802.11 networks.


Motivation
----------

Testing 802.11 protocols and implementations for bugs or security vulnerabilities requires a simple and flexible AP implementation. This library aims to provide these features by using the popular packet manipulation program 'Scapy' for data transmission and reception. 


Installation
------------

You will need to have the following packages installed:
- ```scapy```
- ```ip```
- ```airmon-ng```
- ```dnsmasq``` (optional)

Then, run ```python2 setup.py install``` to install ```scapy-fakeap```.


Examples
--------

First, set up your device in monitor mode. You can use ```airmon-ng``` or ```iw```:

```
# iw dev wlan0 interface add mon0 type monitor
# ifconfig mon0 up
```

From there, setting up a basic AP with ```scapy-fakeap``` is extremely simple, as shown in the example below:

```python
# This example is a simple 'hello world' for scapy-fakeap.
# An open network will be created that can be joined by 802.11 enabled devices.

from fakeap import *

ap = FakeAccessPoint('mon0', 'Hello scapy-fakeap world!')
ap.run()
```

For more examples, please see the 'examples' folder.


Callbacks
---------

The behaviour of the AP can be completely customized by changing the callbacks associated with a certain event. To do this, pass a custom ```Callbacks()``` object to the ```FakeAccessPoint``` constructor or to an instance during runtime. Currently, the following callbacks are provided:

- ```cb_recv_pkt```: Triggered every time a packet is received. This callback defines when all other callbacks are triggered.
- ```cb_dot11_probe_req```: Triggered on reception of a Probe Request frame. The default behaviour is to reply with a Probe Response frame.
- ```cb_dot11_beacon```: Triggered every 0.1 seconds. The default behaviour is to send a Beacon frame.
- ```cb_dot11_auth```: Triggered on reception of an Authentication Request frame. The default behaviour is to reply with an Authentication Response frame.
- ```cb_dot11_assoc_req```: Triggered on reception of an Association Request frame. The default behaviour is to reply with an Association Response frame.
- ```cb_dot11_rts```: Triggered on reception of an RTS frame. The default behaviour is to reply with a CTS frame.
- ```cb_arp_req```: Triggered on reception of an ARP Request. The default behaviour is to reply with an ARP Response.
- ```cb_dot1X_eap_req```: Triggered on reception of an 802.1X EAP Request frame. The default behaviour is to reply with an 802.1X EAP Response frame.
- ```cb_dhcp_discover```: Triggered on reception of a DHCP Discover message. The default behaviour is to forward the message to ```dnsmasq```.
- ```cb_dhcp_request```: Triggered on reception of a DHCP Request message. The default behaviour is to forward the message to ```dnsmasq```.
- ```cb_dns_request```: Triggered on reception of a DNS Request message. The default behaviour is to forward the message to ```dnsmasq```.
- ```cb_tint_read```: Triggered on reception of a packet from the ```fakeap``` virtual interface. This callback defines when callbacks related to this interface are triggered.


### Writing your own callback:
The following example shows how a custom callback for a ```Callbacks()``` instance can be easily created:

```python
# This example demonstrates how to create a new callback for a specific Callbacks() instance.
# The callback will trigger each time an EAPOL packet is sniffed.

from types import MethodType
from scapy.layers.dot11 import EAPOL
from fakeap import *


def do_something(self):  # Our custom callback
    print("Got EAPOL packet!")


def my_recv_pkt(self, packet):  # We override recv_pkt to include a trigger for our callback
    if EAPOL in packet:
        self.cb_do_something()
    self.recv_pkt(packet)

ap = FakeAccessPoint('mon0', 'My first callback!')
ap.wpa = AP_WLAN_TYPE_WPA2  # Enable WPA2
ap.ieee8021x = 1  # Enable 802.1X (WPA-Enterprise)
my_callbacks = Callbacks(ap)
my_callbacks.cb_recv_pkt = MethodType(my_recv_pkt, my_callbacks)
my_callbacks.cb_do_something = MethodType(do_something, my_callbacks)
ap.callbacks = my_callbacks

ap.run()
```


Service interaction
-------------------

Upon instantiation of a ```FakeAccessPoint``` object, scapy-fakeap automatically creates the ```fakeap``` virtual interface, which may be used for interacting with other services. For example, you can set it as the listen interface for ```dnsmasq``` to use a DHCP server for your fake AP.
